# speedtest-automation
MVP for running a speedtest, saving the results and visualizing them via plotly in a locally available web page.

Most of the actual speedtest code was written by roest01 in his docker-speedtest-analyzer (https://github.com/roest01/docker-speedtest-analyser) but unfortunately my NAS does not like Docker so I decided to build my own, very much boiled down version of this.
